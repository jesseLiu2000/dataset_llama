The trucker was unable to stop before hitting the cattle but was not driving carelessly. While he was not injured in the collision, the trucker sustained damage to his truck and lost income during the time it took to repair the truck.The trucker sued the farmer for his damages and invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. At trial, the farmer introduced evidence that his cattle pen was of a sufficient height to prevent cattle from stepping over it and was constructed of thick steel pipe sitting in concrete with a substantial top rail. A sturdy pen such as this one would be more difficult for cattle to break through than one constructed of barbed wire or electric wire.Should the trial court allow the case to go to the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction?\n A.

The two- year residency requirement was intended to prevent debtors from defrauding creditors by moving to a state solely to take advantage of a favorable home- exemption law.A state’s law prohibited the execution of a judgment against a debtor’s home. After the federal amendment, the state amended its law “to conform with the federal bankruptcy amendments,” making the debtor’s home exemption unavailable to any person who had established permanent residency in the state less than two years before entry of the judgment.Following these amendments, a man moved to the state and purchased a home.

The speaker has challenged the conviction on constitutional grounds.How should the court rule?\n A. The ordinance is constitutional, because it is narrowly tailored to further a significant government interest that is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and individuals have other ways of communicating their messages.\n B. The ordinance is constitutional, because it regulates conduct rather than speech.\n C.

The prosecutor’s first question during her cross-examination is, “On the day of the robbery, you were questioned by an investigator and told him that [the defendant] had left the house by 8 a.m., didn’t you?” The girlfriend denies having made the statement and says that the investigator must have misunderstood her. In rebuttal, the prosecutor proposes to call the investigator, who would testify that the girlfriend told him in their interview that the defendant had left the house by 8 a.m. on the day of the robbery. The defendant objects to the investigator’s proposed testimony about the girlfriend’s prior statement.Should the court allow the investigator’s testimony about the girlfriend’s prior statement?\n A. No, because extrinsic evidence may not be used to prove a prior inconsistent statement.\n B. No, because the girlfriend’s earlier statement is hearsay not within any exception.\n C. Yes, but only to impeach the girlfriend’s direct testimony.\n D. Yes, to impeach the girlfriend’s direct testimony and to prove the time the defendant left home on the day of the robbery.",

When the six-month listing period was about to expire, the broker presented an offer to purchase for the full listing price.The broker did not disclose to the seller that the offer came from the broker’s daughter, who planned to resell the building for $600,000 to a company with which she had been negotiating.

The broker, because the seller was obligated to sell to anyone at the full listing price.\n C.

The employee agreed with the agency to settle the action in return for 12 monthly settlement payments. The agreement, however, was based on the employee’s mistaken assumption that the settlement payments would constitute “earnable salary” under state law, entitling the employee to retire with 30 years of service at a higher pension rate.Fifteen months after the court entered a judgment dismissing the employee’s claim with prejudice, the employee learned that the payments did not constitute earnable salary under state law. The employee promptly moved to reopen the judgment on the ground of mistake.Should the court grant the motion?\n A. No, because mistake is not a ground on which a court may reopen a judgment.\n B. No, because the employee did not file the motion within one year of the court’s entry of judgment.\n C. Yes, because the agency would be unjustly enriched if it did not have to pay the employee a higher pension rate for 30 years of service.\n D.

Among other terms, the mortgage required the man to make all monthly payments of principal and interest on time, to pay all property taxes and assessments when due, to keep the property insured, and to not damage or impair the property or commit waste on the property. The man used the warehouses to store inventory for his business.A few years later, the man changed the nature of his business. His business plan indicated that he would need only one of the two warehouses and that the warehouse to be used would need renovation. The man renovated one of the warehouses and tore the other one down and did not replace it.When the bank learned of the man’s actions, it accelerated the note and sent the man a letter containing a notice of default and intention to commence foreclosure proceedings. At the time the letter was sent, the man was current on his monthly mortgage payments and property insurance premiums.After the man failed to pay the accelerated amount, the bank filed a foreclosure action. In that action, the man defended by offering into evidence an appraisal showing that the then-current value of the property was more than the balance due on the mortgage and more than the value of the property before the man renovated the one warehouse and tore down the other.Which party is likely to prevail?\n A. The bank, because a default will be implied by the court under these facts.\n B. The bank, because the man violated the terms of the mortgage.\n C. The man, because he is current on his mortgage payments and property insurance premiums.\n D. The man, because the bank’s collateral has not been impaired and in fact has been enhanced.",
