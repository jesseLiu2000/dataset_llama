            "choice": "A major problem facing industrial societies is their exponentially increasing production of toxic waste. Environmental regulations and expenses for landfills and incinerators have increased significantly in recent years. In an effort to save time and money, many industries have turned to alternative methods of hazardous-waste disposal, including increased use of deep-well injection. In this method, wells are drilled into porous and permeable rock strata that are already saturated with salt water. Liquid wastes are then injected into the rock strata. Most of these wells are drilled to a depth of at least 300 meters—the minimum depth that generally puts the injected waste at a safe distance below any aquifer, in this case a rock stratum containing drinkable water. Such wells are rarely deeper than 1,800 meters, because below this depth it is more cost-effective to consider an alternative method of disposal. Deep-well injection, which has been used to some extent since the 1930s, has become a matter of controversy as growing numbers of communities come to rely on underground sources of drinking water. The controversy arises because there are three serious problems with this method of waste disposal.Under the best conditions, wastes are injected into rock strata saturated with salt water and separated by impermeable rock strata from aquifers containing drinkable water. However, injection wells may leak, allowing significant amounts of noxious chemicals to mix with supplies of drinking water. In other cases, mistakes by personnel working on the wells may lead to the pollution of aquifers. In one such case, workers installing a 500-meter-deep well left a gap along approximately 30 meters of its steel casing. This allowed waste to escape at depth of only 200 meters, threatening a regional aquifer supplying water to 100,000 people. Because such accidents take place deep within the earth, people may be exposed to dangerous levels of waste materials for long periods of time before the problem is even discovered.The third problem associated with deep-well injection arises from the fact that it is nearly impossible to predict how the injected wastes will be acted on by the geological features of the injection area. Unlike surface water, the water in underground rock strata does not flow entirely under the influence of gravity. Moving along subterranean pressure gradients, it can flow in any direction and, in some cases, can be transported thousands of meters per year through geologic faults, porous rock, or other geologic formations.The significant uncertainty about where injected wastes will flow, along with the possibilities of mechanical failure and human error, makes deep-well injection a risky means of managing hazardous wastes. Unfortunately, as societies produce more toxic waste, industry will rely increasingly upon this relatively cheap, efficient means of disposal.1. Which one of the following most accurately states the main point of the passage?\n A. Deep-well injection of hazardous wastes is unsafe when expensive precautionary measures are not taken.\n B. Although deep-well injection of hazardous wastes can be unsafe, it is generally safe when proper procedures are followed and sites are carefully selected.\n C. Because of the high costs and extensive regulations associated with other methods, deep-well injection has wholly supplanted alternative methods of hazardous-waste disposal.\n D. The increasing use of deep-well injection as a method of hazardous-waste disposal is seriously problematic.\n E. Careful design and location of deep-well-injection facilities is important because communities commonly rely on groundwater for drinking.",

Recently, the term “trickster” has also appeared in criticism of sixteenth and seventeenth-century European literature, particularly in reference to the picaresque novel and its central character, the picaro (Spanish for “rogue”): both the picaro and the trickster are heroes of episodic adventures, and both live on the peripheries of society and are morally flawed.Yet closer examination reveals that applying the term “trickster” to both characters obscures essential differences between them. The picaro—typically a male character—operates primarily as an agent of satire. Most commonly, the picaro’s adventures begin when he spontaneously yields to his own roguish, though innocent, impulses. The picaro indulges in vices and follies with relish and freedom, much to the outrage of other members of society, who often secretly indulge in similar pastimes out of a habitual compulsion. Thus the picaro’s authenticity serves as a foil to the perceived hypocrisy of conventional society. To such a society, the picaro can represent a dangerous, disruptive freedom, and it reacts by marginalizing him. It is in that distance between the ostensibly disreputable freedom of the picaro and the hypocrisy of the safely ensconced social being—that the satire occurs.But the trickster, usually an animal acting as a human agent, does not serve a satiric function. For while the picaresque novel takes place in and satirizes human society, the trickster operates in the ahistorical world of myth; where the targets of the picaresque novel are the idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies of a historical human society, trickster stories seek, using the trickster's negative example, to instruct listeners about moral behavior of individuals. In fact, whatever flaws the trickster reveals are thoroughly the trickster's own. They are not a foil to a corrupt society; they are instead essential to who the trickster is. The trickster is a comic figure precisely because of these somewhat irrational, compulsive, and foolish—in short, mortal—actions. Similarly, the trickster is a socially peripheral character not by being forced to the periphery by a hypocritical society, but rather because the trickster's thoroughly flawed character makes the trickster fundamentally antisocial, even anarchic, all the while helping listeners to avoid these flaws.It is this combination of mythic setting and mortal weakness that determines the particular targets of the trickster's comic high jinks: the eternal and unchanging foibles of mortal beings. In one story, for example, a coyote trickster falls in love with a star. The trickster is quite tenacious and human, even though the object of desire is beyond reasonable mortal possibility. In the end the star takes the trickster up into the sky, only to let the trickster fall back to Earth; the story's listeners realize that the trickster has gotten a comeuppance for reaching beyond proper limits, but all the while they recognize in themselves the trickster's extravagant hopes.8.

Recently, the term “trickster” has also appeared in criticism of sixteenth and seventeenth-century European literature, particularly in reference to the picaresque novel and its central character, the picaro (Spanish for “rogue”): both the picaro and the trickster are heroes of episodic adventures, and both live on the peripheries of society and are morally flawed.Yet closer examination reveals that applying the term “trickster” to both characters obscures essential differences between them. The picaro—typically a male character—operates primarily as an agent of satire. Most commonly, the picaro’s adventures begin when he spontaneously yields to his own roguish, though innocent, impulses. The picaro indulges in vices and follies with relish and freedom, much to the outrage of other members of society, who often secretly indulge in similar pastimes out of a habitual compulsion. Thus the picaro’s authenticity serves as a foil to the perceived hypocrisy of conventional society. To such a society, the picaro can represent a dangerous, disruptive freedom, and it reacts by marginalizing him. It is in that distance between the ostensibly disreputable freedom of the picaro and the hypocrisy of the safely ensconced social being—that the satire occurs.But the trickster, usually an animal acting as a human agent, does not serve a satiric function. For while the picaresque novel takes place in and satirizes human society, the trickster operates in the ahistorical world of myth; where the targets of the picaresque novel are the idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies of a historical human society, trickster stories seek, using the trickster's negative example, to instruct listeners about moral behavior of individuals. In fact, whatever flaws the trickster reveals are thoroughly the trickster's own. They are not a foil to a corrupt society; they are instead essential to who the trickster is. The trickster is a comic figure precisely because of these somewhat irrational, compulsive, and foolish—in short, mortal—actions. Similarly, the trickster is a socially peripheral character not by being forced to the periphery by a hypocritical society, but rather because the trickster's thoroughly flawed character makes the trickster fundamentally antisocial, even anarchic, all the while helping listeners to avoid these flaws.It is this combination of mythic setting and mortal weakness that determines the particular targets of the trickster's comic high jinks: the eternal and unchanging foibles of mortal beings. In one story, for example, a coyote trickster falls in love with a star. The trickster is quite tenacious and human, even though the object of desire is beyond reasonable mortal possibility. In the end the star takes the trickster up into the sky, only to let the trickster fall back to Earth; the story's listeners realize that the trickster has gotten a comeuppance for reaching beyond proper limits, but all the while they recognize in themselves the trickster's extravagant hopes.11. Based on the passage, the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the literary criticism mentioned in the second sentence of the first paragraph?\n A. It has systematically denigrated the literary traditions of Native Americans.\n B. Its use of the trickster appellation has nothing to do with the Native American trickster character.\n C. Its reading of picaresque novels is at odds with its reading of Native American trickster stories.\n D. It reflects an attempt to be precise in the use of literary terminology.\n E. It bases its analysis on an incomplete understanding of trickster stories.",

            "choice": "Passage A is adapted from an essay by historian Christopher Ricks; passage B is from the introduction, by historian Paulina Kewes, to a book in which Ricks’s essay appears.Passage AIn her 1996 history of plagiarism in English Renaissance drama, Laura J. Rosenthal tells us that her purpose is to “question differences between plagiarism, imitation, adaptation, repetition, and originality.” But such rhetorical questioning invariably leads to the required postmodern answer: that there is no difference between these things—other than that those in power use the opprobrious term “plagiarism” when the work in question emanates from those whom they dislike. Though the book is animated by a political fervor that is clearly moral, the author writes as if a political approach has to extirpate all moral considerations from any discussion of plagiarism. What in moral terms is amatter of honesty or dishonesty—plagiarism being dishonest—is instead reduced to “the cultural location of the text and the position of the author.”The consequence of a historical approach that seeks to “delegitimize” the distinction between imitation and plagiarism is that it demeans and degrades moral thought. That no moral standard is universal does not of itself entail that moral standards are nothing but expressions of power. Moral conventions, though not universal, may be valuable, indispensable, worthy of respect. The extirpation of moral considerations from political histories such as this one is a sad loss to political history.Passage BThe idea of plagiarism, like all ideas, has a history. (30) To earlier generations it had semantic inflections and resonances different from those we recognize today. The varied impulses behind these varying views—which have themselves evolved in response to commercial circumstances, new theories of artistic creation, and developments in copyright law—have repeatedly complicated judgments of plagiarism. Despite an abiding sense that plagiarism is morally wrong, there has been much fluidity in the way the charge has been applied, and virtually identical acts of illicit appropriation have been sometimes denounced, sometimes excused, and sometimes praised.Christopher Ricks is suspicious of historical approaches to ethical issues; to him, emphasis on change across generations produces an extenuating moral relativism that shields the evil of plagiarism from its due obloquy. But there are historical approaches, and there are historical approaches.Ricks is rightly dismissive of the postmodern reduction of moral standards to expressions of power. And it is also true that there has been some shoddy scholarship that anachronistically projects modern-day ideologies having to do with gender, race, or class onto historically remote controversies. Yet bad history is no argument against history itself. To reconstruct the attitudes of the past is not necessarily to vindicate them. It is merely to acknowledge that whatever we might think is the correct way of apprehending plagiarism—and there is hardly a consensus on the matter even today—our predecessors may not, and often did not, share our perspectives.14.

            "choice": "The use of criminal sanctions against corporations is well established, but the practice has recently come under fire from legal theorists who maintain that corporations should be held civilly rather than criminally liable for wrongdoing. Civil liability, these theorists argue, shares important features with criminal liability: both impose punishment on a company, both aim at deterrence, and both degrade a company’s reputation. Yet, they claim, civil liability is better able to determine appropriate levels of damages. Furthermore, because criminal liability causes a greater loss of reputation, its overall cost to corporations is far higher than that of civil liability; this additional cost is borne by society at large in the form of higher product prices. Finally, civil liability is also more cost-effective from the point of view of the government: the greater procedural protections of criminal law make deterrence through criminal prosecution extremely expensive.Even if it is less economical, however, criminal liability is a much stronger deterrent. The considerable enforcement powers involved, including the ability to detain and question corporate officials, are themselves significant deterrents.

Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?\n A. Although the use of criminal sanctions against corporations has recently faced criticism, it remains the most effective way of deterring corporate wrongdoing.\n B. While civil sanctions against corporations would be more cost-effective than criminal sanctions, it is difficult to identify victims of corporate wrongdoing who have the resources to file civil suits.\n C. Neither civil sanctions against corporations nor criminal sanctions against individuals within corporations are capable of deterring corporate wrongdoing.\n D. The best way to ensure that corporations improve their practices is to use criminal sanctions against both corporations and individuals within corporations.\n E. The use of criminal sanctions against individuals within corporations is preferable to the use of civil sanctions because the latter fails to censure wrongdoing adequately.",

However, many experienced climbers believe that the rising annual toll of deaths and injuries among climbers in these regions can be significantly reduced only by completely abolishing the rescue squads.Which one of the following, if true, would most help to justify the apparently paradoxical belief of the experienced climbers?\n A. It is difficult to recruit and train members for the rescue squads.\n B. The recording of deaths and injuries tends to be more accurate in mountain regions served by rescue squads.\n C. People who commonly take risk with their lives and health do not expect other people to take those risks to rescue them.\n D. Most of the people injured or killed while mountain climbing were not adequately prepared for the dangers they would face.\n E. The lower the risk of climbing a particular mountain is perceived to be, the greater the number of less competent climbers who attempt to climb it.",

Furthermore, we can expect our radio telescopes to detect signs of such beings. Alien scientists would have basically the same understanding of mathematics and physics that humans have. Thus they would inevitably discover gravity, electromagnetism, and other fundamental physical phenomena and then develop technologies such as radio communication.Ashley: That is like saying they would inevitably have the same legal or political systems that humans do. Our science, mathematics, and technology are unique outgrowths of our physiology, cognitive makeup, and environment. Using radio telescopes to search for Intelligent life is a waste of time and money.The dialogue provides the most evidence that Paula and Ashley disagree with each other about whether\n A. it is probable that there are intelligent alien beings who have developed radio communication\n B. it is probable that there are intelligent alien beings who have the same legal or political systems that humans do\n C. our technology is influenced by our cognitive makeup\n D. there is likely to be intelligent life on other planets\n E. scientists should spend more time and money on the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life",

The completed apartment complex would strengthen Sierra s economy, and a stronger economy would benefit every Sierra resident. Therefore, the residents of Sierra should vote in favor of a local tax to fund construction of the proposed road.Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justify the developer’s reasoning?\n A. If a construction project is necessary in order to strengthen a town’s economy, then the residents of that town should vote in favor of a local tax to fund that construction project.\n B. The residents of a town should not vote in favor of a local tax to fund a construction project unless that construction project will produce results that benefit all of those residents.\n C.

Historian: Because medieval epistemology (theory of knowledge) is a complex subject, intellectual historians have, until recently, failed to produce a definition that would help to determine what should and what should not be included in it. Clearly, the solution is to define medieval epistemology simply as “the epistemological beliefs of the medieval epistemologists.” That way, if we want to know whether medieval epistemology includes some epistemological claim, we just ask whether any medieval epistemologists believed it. If any did, it is part of medieval epistemology: if any medieval epistemologists believed the opposite, then that opposite claim is part of medieval epistemology.Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the historian’s argument?\n A. Medieval epistemologists held some of the same epistemological beliefs as did ancient epistemologists.\n B. The epistemological beliefs of medieval epistemologists depended upon their beliefs about nonepistemological matters.\n C. The writings of most medieval epistemologists include passages that are clearly not about epistemology.\n D. Some medieval epistemologists had epistemological beliefs that contradicted the epistemological beliefs of other medieval epistemologists.\n E.

However, this development raises the possibility that the drugs will end up in the general food supply, since if pollen from a drug-producing crop drifts into a nearby field in which an ordinary, non-drug-producing crop of the same species is being grown, the pollen could fertilize that crop and turn it into a drug-producing crop as well.Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken consumer advocate’s argument?\n A. As far as scientists know, none of the pharmaceuticals produced by genetically engineered crops would present any danger to public health if they were present in the general food supply.\n B. If pollen from a genetically engineered crop is prevented from drifting into fields in which ordinary crops of the same species are being grown, then there is no risk of the pollen fertilizing the latter crops.\n C.
